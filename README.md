Selenium on Steroids
====================
The projects targets QA automation engineers that want a clean and simple way of creating Selenium tests 
allowing them to focus more on designing the test rather than dealing with technical dificulties. 
Using Maven profiles the instantiation of a WebDriver object with different kind of settings reduces to a simple
seeting of some predefined properties.
The project enhances the functionality of the WebDriver by offering additional methods for common tasks.
You have also available different utility methods in order to interact with simple files, properties files,
Excel documents, XML documents, Databases, post XML calls, etc, basically everything you need for your data drivern scenarios.
